# lbbw_quality

Quality Assessment working group for the LOFAR Long Baseline Pipeline during the Lorentz Centre workshop on [High Resolution Surveying with International LOFAR](https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2018/983/info.php3?wsid=983&venue=Snellius), from 19 Mar 2018 through 23 Mar 2018.

We are adapting quality control scripts (astrometry, flux accuracy, dynamic range, etc.) from the [DDFacet](https://github.com/mhardcastle/ddf-pipeline) [Quality Pipeline](https://github.com/mhardcastle/ddf-pipeline/blob/master/scripts/quality_pipeline.py) for use in the LOFAR [Long Baseline Pipeline](https://github.com/lmorabit/long_baseline_pipeline).
